- Completing this was a task. I had some time to overcome the grid, and I could still use some tweaks.


    ## After Evaluation: 
    After Speaking with Josue, I realized where I had the typo on my css code, It was a mistype. Also not adding the "if statement" in JavaScript, and ID selector in CSS, was an oversight. If my memory serves me right, I actually had an ID selector and when I changed my "ipsum Lorem" on the index.html page, I took it out. Those things have been added and updated to the Capstone.
